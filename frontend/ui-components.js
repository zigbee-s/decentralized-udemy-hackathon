          Welcome to our innovative tutorial platform! We've created a unique marketplace where content creators can share
          their expertise through video NFT tutorials. Here's how it works: creators upload their tutorials as NFTs, and
          anyone can purchase these NFTs to gain the right to distribute the course. When a tutorial is sold by a buyer, a
          percentage of the sale is paid as a royalty to the original owner.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        <FaRuler className='text-red-600' />
          But we didn't stop there! We've also incorporated NFT certificates, ensuring that your achievements are
          recognized and verified. After completing a course, you can download your personalized certificate as an NFT,
          adding a touch of exclusivity to your accomplishments.
        </p>

          Our platform combines the power of NFTs with the flexibility of a tutorial marketplace, allowing creators to
          monetize their content and buyers to explore, distribute, and sell these valuable tutorials. Join us today and
          become a part of this decentralized and innovative learning community!

        Your contract is storing a greeting message in the NEAR blockchain. To
        change it you need to sign in using the NEAR Wallet. It is very simple,
        just use the button below.

        Do not worry, this app runs in the test network ("testnet"). It works
        just like the main network ("mainnet"), but using NEAR Tokens that are
        only for testing!

        Look at that! A Hello World app! This greeting is stored on the NEAR blockchain. Check it out:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Look in <code>frontend/App.js</code> - you'll see <code>getGreeting</code> and <code>setGreeting</code> being called on <code>contract</code>. What's this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, this <code>contract</code> code is defined in <code>./contract</code> â€“ this is the source code for your <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview">smart contract</a>.</li>
        <li>
          When you run <code>npm run deploy</code>, the code in <code>./contract</code> gets deployed to the NEAR testnet. You can see how this happens by looking in <code>package.json</code>.</li>
